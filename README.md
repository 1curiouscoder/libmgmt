# librarymgmt
This is a Library management system that helps to automate some tasks in a daily library operations
I have used bootstrap framework for frontend which is made dynamic using jQuery , the server request are managed by jQuery and processed by php in backend . Server used is Apache and Mysql database.
 This is my library management system which consists of following features that any basic system should have -
1. Homepage containing a brief stats about the type of books.
2.Search option is Included that contains various filters so user can do a custom Search to get better results,search uses jQuery for front end and PHP at backend.
3. Database management- this tab shows all the books and corresponding data that are present in database in a tabular format ,I have used mdbootstrap pagination table which uses datatable property of jQuery to add dynamic features to a table.
4. CRUD - the crud operation is carried out in this system in 2 ways a)manual b) import file
Both methods are easy to use and can be improved further.
INSERTION - can be done manually or automatically though an excel file.
RETRIEVE - search can be used to retrieve data.
UPDATE - it can be done in 2 ways manually in search or automatically though an excel file.
DELETE - it can be done in search option.
5. Accession record - This tab is used to view the issued and returned books to the library.
